	/* 1. Zach Post and Marko McDowell
	 * 
	 * 2. Stack implements the List interface, which inherits from
	 * the Collection superclass
	 * 
	 * 3. Stacks allow for memory of the order of data entries,
	 * but do not allow insertion or deletion at any point aside
	 * from the top. Think a stack of books. You can only remove
	 * data at one end of the stack. Items are removed in the 
	 * opposite order they are inserted in (last-in, first-out 
	 * order). The undo function uses a stack. A Run-Time stack
	 * stores methods and their parameters and local variables
	 * and closes out of them in order to maintain data that is
	 * still needed and clears data that isn't.
	 * 
	 * 4. Stack<DataType> name = new Stack<DataType>(data);
	 * ^this is how to instantiate a Stack
	 * 
	 * 5.  Stacks have only four methods that can be used:
	 * 
	 * name.push(item1);
	 * ^The push method. This adds the itemToBeAdded to the top
	 * of the stack. If you were to run the following:
	 * name.push(item1);
	 * name.push(item2);
	 * name.push(Item3);
	 * You will end with a stack name with items [item1,
	 * item2, item3].
	 * 
	 * DataType item = name.pop();
	 * ^The Pop method. This removes the top value of the stack.
	 * name would now have values [item1, 
	 * item2] and the object item would set to
	 * item3.
	 * 
	 * peekedItem = name.peek();
	 * ^The Peek Method. This sets peekedItem to the top item in
	 * the stack, but leaves the stack unchanged.
	 * peekedItem would have the value nextItemToBeAdded, and the
	 * stack would still have the values [item1, 
	 * item2].
	 * 
	 * name.empty();
	 * ^The Empty Method. All this does is return a boolean if
	 * and only if the stack is completely empty. This would 
	 * return false.
	 * 
	 * 6. Stacks can be used with the undo method, making a 
	 * counter for verifying balances for equations, making a
	 * Run-Time stack, and stacks can be used for applications
	 * of Path-Finding, Artificial intelligence, menu navigation,
	 * card games, etc.
	 * 
	 * 7. Caution should be taken to avoid stack overflow errors.
	 * These can be caused easily with careless recursion calls.
	 * Make sure you always have a termination condition when 
	 * using loops to avoid this.
